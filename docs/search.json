This will also mean they have to understand how and when to use the mice package in R and what methods to use for each variable.\n\nWhat parts are likely to be tricky?\n\nUnderstanding the methods mathematically can be difficult as I do not fully understand the methods but implementing them in R is a task that can definitely be understood. This can be done with the mice package. I think a tricky element of this package can be understanding the prediction matrix along with what it is actually doing when the imputation is taking place.\n\nWhat resources are already available on this topic that may be helpful? Look for e.g. software vignettes, package documentation, papers about software packages, and so on.\n\nThere is vignettes available which will be attached in a section in the user guide along with the references. We can see that there is also R documentation papers on this package which will also be attached.",

    "text": "Assignment Flow\nThis project is set up to scaffold this user guide and set you up for success.\nStart at topic.qmd and identify a topic for your user guide.\nOnce you’ve proposed a topic and received my approval/feedback, you can convert the contents of topic.qmd into an introductory paragraph in your report. Please leave the topic.qmd file as an appendix, to document the different stages of this project.\nOnce we’ve agreed on a topic for your user guide, you will proceed to needs.qmd and task-analysis.qmd. Both will be submitted at the same check-in, and both will be included in your final report as appendices. You should be able to re-purpose most of the information in task-analysis.qmd to orient the user to different components of the task you’ve chosen.\nYour next step is to actually write the content that satisfies the work you outlined in task-analysis.qmd.\nOnce you’re finished with that, ideally, you’ll have plenty of time to edit and streamline your report. Feel free to trade reports with a friend and try to complete your friend’s task - this will help you both identify areas where the guide isn’t as clear. Try to complete the task with a different data set - that often helps find trouble spots.\nWhen you submit your final report, you may remove index.qmd from the _quarto.yml file, which will remove this chapter (which is quite unnecessary for your user) from the report. You should also take the time to make sure your name is listed as both author and copyright holder in the _quarto.yml file. Feel free to make a custom cover for your manual if you would like to do so. You can also tweak the CSS/theme for the book, so long as you’re conscious of accessibility concerns.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBuilding the report\n\n\n\nIf you are using RStudio to complete this report, you can hit (Ctrl/Cmd)-Shift-B to build the whole report. You can also type quarto render . on the command line in the project folder to accomplish the same thing.\nIf you have questions about how to customize or debug your book, it may be helpful to start at the quarto book documentation (Posit PBC 2024).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPosit PBC. 2024. “Creating a Book.
