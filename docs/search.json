    "text": "What does someone trying to accomplish your chosen task need help with?\n\nThey will need help understanding why we need to estimate for missing values in our data set along with a method to use to properly estimate missing values. This will also mean they have to understand how and when to use the mice package in R and what methods to use for each variable.\n\nWhat parts are likely to be tricky?\n\nUnderstanding the methods mathematically can be difficult as I do not fully understand the methods but implementing them in R is a task that can definitely be understood. This can be done with the mice package. I think a tricky element of this package can be understanding the prediction matrix along with what it is actually doing when the imputation is taking place.\n\nWhat resources are already available on this topic that may be helpful? Look for e.g. software vignettes, package documentation, papers about software packages, and so on.\n\nThere is vignettes available which will be attached in a section in the user guide along with the references. We can see that there is also R documentation papers on this package which will also be attached.",

    "text": "1.1 Introduction\nData has become the lifeblood on today’s world. It is used in almost every industry to track, organize, and solve businesses problems. This is why it is more crucial than ever to understand how to handle data properly to get results that can help you grow your business. One of the issues that comes across when analyzing a data set in dealing with missing values. Our first instinct is to throw those values out and analyze that data that we do have, yet this is not a viable option according to Little, Little (2021). Little discusses in his paper a variety of ways to properly estimate missing values in a data set, one option is imputation likelihood methods. This method allows you to get estimates for your missing values which intern allows you to get accurate information from your data set as a whole. A package called “mice” found in R can complete these missing data estimations which allow you to properly analyze your data, Van Buuren and Groothuis-Oudshoorn (n.d.). This guide will attempt to discuss the processes and methods involved with using this package on a data set. This example will be used as a guide to understanding how to implement this package on future data that you may come across.",

Please leave the topic.qmd file as an appendix, to document the different stages of this project.\nOnce we’ve agreed on a topic for your user guide, you will proceed to needs.qmd and task-analysis.qmd. Both will be submitted at the same check-in, and both will be included in your final report as appendices. You should be able to re-purpose most of the information in task-analysis.qmd to orient the user to different components of the task you’ve chosen.\nYour next step is to actually write the content that satisfies the work you outlined in task-analysis.qmd.\nOnce you’re finished with that, ideally, you’ll have plenty of time to edit and streamline your report. Feel free to trade reports with a friend and try to complete your friend’s task - this will help you both identify areas where the guide isn’t as clear. Try to complete the task with a different data set - that often helps find trouble spots.\nWhen you submit your final report, you may remove index.qmd from the _quarto.yml file, which will remove this chapter (which is quite unnecessary for your user) from the report. You should also take the time to make sure your name is listed as both author and copyright holder in the _quarto.yml file. Feel free to make a custom cover for your manual if you would like to do so. You can also tweak the CSS/theme for the book, so long as you’re conscious of accessibility concerns.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBuilding the report\n\n\n\nIf you are using RStudio to complete this report, you can hit (Ctrl/Cmd)-Shift-B to build the whole report. You can also type quarto render . on the command line in the project folder to accomplish the same thing.\nIf you have questions about how to customize or debug your book, it may be helpful to start at the quarto book documentation (Posit PBC 2024).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPosit PBC. 2024. “Creating a Book.
