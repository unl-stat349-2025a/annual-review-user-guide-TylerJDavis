Here are some questions to guide you through the process of doing a task analysis. You don't have to specifically answer each one of these (and some may not apply), but they should get you started thinking in the right direction. 

What are the prerequisites, for both knowledge and e.g. software setup? 

The perquisites are understanding how to anayze data and run a linear model. Knowing what missing data is. Knowimg basic statistical concepts not necessarily the mathmatics behind it just how to apply it. 

What are the basic requirements for any data that the method is used on? 
  - Are missing values allowed? 
  Missing values are allowed and in fact that is the whole purpose of this method is to analyze the data using imputaiton liklihood methods for missing data.
  - Should the data be confined within a certain range? 
  - Does the data have to be approximately normally distributed? 

What are the basic components of the task?
  - Outline these in a bit more detail
- having data with missing values
- knowing what not to do with missing values
- knowng how to implement package in R to estimate for missing values
- know how to apply this in a variety of situations. 


What decisions does the user need to be prepared to make on the fly?

- what method of imputation to use
- how to use the package in R


What questions should the user ask of the "first draft" of the product? What adjustments may need to be made?


## Additional Guidance 

Your check-in should answer these basic questions (and similar concerns that apply more directly to your topic). 

Once you've completed the check-in, you can use this section to jump-start an introduction/set-up/getting started section in your user guide. 
This document should remain as an appendix to your main report.
